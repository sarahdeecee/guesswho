This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Purpose

This is an interactive single-page app of a Guess Who game using video game characters.

## User Stories

- [ ] As a player, I want to choose a character from the board so that my opponent can guess who I picked.
- [ ] As a player, I want to flip down or eliminate characters based on answers so I can keep track of my guesses.
- [ ] As a player, I want to see unique game characters with names and avatars so I can identify them easily.
- [ ] As a player, I want to filter characters by specific traits.
- [ ] As a player, I want to see who won the game and a summary of the game afterwards.
